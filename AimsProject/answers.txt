1. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer: 
- Because this is an overloading method. The signal is different. So it’s ok to have multiple methods with the same name with different parameters

2.Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 

Answer:
- Technically, Java is always pass by value. 
Even though a variable might hold a reference to an object, that object reference is a value that represents the object’s location in memory. 
Object references are therefore passed by value.
